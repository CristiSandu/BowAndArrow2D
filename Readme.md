## GamePlay

As a gameplay, our goal is to **collect as many points** during the game by **hitting red balloons** and _avoiding_ as much as possible the _yellow balloons_ that reduce points on impact. All this in times when we avoid shurikens.  
The **speed** at which the arrow moves is defined by the time the **left click was pressed**.

The player uses the following keys:

| Key        | Action          |
| :--------- | :-------------- |
| W          | move up Bow     |
| S          | move down Bow   |
| mose move  | arrow direction |
| left click | shoot the arrow |
